                    Lake Litter Solutions (LLS) was started in late 2021 under the EPICS @ ASU program.
                    Since its creation, we've innovated 4 unique concepts, engineered 3 prototypes, and
                    had over 30 people contribute to the project. As of June 2024, only 3 members remain,
                    as we are shifting programs.

                <p class="section1_alt_text_left">
                    As a team, we've won over $15,000 of funding for our project. Continually performing
                    above and beyond in pitch competitions, design reviews, and community outreach events.
